              Not a clinical image. Every other asset in IMAGES is an
              anatomical piles model or diagram — graphic, and piles-only on a
              page that also sells circumcision and gynecomastia. On a section
              whose job is reassurance, a working theatre does that and a
              cutaway of the anal canal actively undoes it.

              It carries no caption: the frame shows a team at work rather than
              a named individual, so there is nothing here to attribute, and a
              plate over it would only cover the operating field. The source is
              2:3 and the frame is 4:5, so it is centre-cropped — the surgeons
              and their hands sit mid-frame and survive that; anchoring to the
              top would trade them for ceiling lights. The fill under it is dark
              to match, or the frame flashes pale before the image lands. */}
