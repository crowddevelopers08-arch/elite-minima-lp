/**
 * Section 01 — the hook, and the form.
 *
 * A single contained panel rather than a full-bleed band: copy in the left
 * half — badge, headline with a coloured closing run, lead, a two-by-two grid
 * of assurances, then a solid CTA beside an outlined one — and the six booking
 * fields in the right half, which is where the content deck puts them.
 *
 * The form used to have a band of its own directly underneath,
 * back when the surgeon's portrait held this column. Both are gone: the deck's
 * arrangement is one screen that asks for the appointment, and a second band
 * repeating "Book Your Consultation" under a hero that already shows the
 * fields is a scroll spent on nothing. `#book` therefore lives on the form
 * column here, so every CTA on the page still lands on the fields.
 *
 * Two things deliberately do not copy the reference. Its panel has large
 * rounded corners; this page has no rounded corner anywhere, and one here
 * would read as a mistake rather than a flourish. And its palette is green on
 * gold — this keeps the page's plum ink and violet, so the hero belongs to the
 * five sections under it.
 *
 * Entrance is `.c-rise` / `.c-dN`: a CSS animation on load, not an in-view
 * observer. The hero is on screen already, and anything gated on a scroll band
 * can be jumped past without ever entering it.
